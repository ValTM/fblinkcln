A small javascriptlet for facebook.com. When you middle click a link it will strip the tracking click id from it and paste it in the window. You can copy it or visit directly from there.

Known issues:
```text
❌ Duplicates the event listeners when you close and reopen the dialog
❌ Doesn't autoscroll when the links become too much
❌ Doesn't work for all link types yet
```

Future plans:
```text
✔️ Better readme
✔️ Auto-open toggle
✔️ Auto-clean on action toggle
✔️ Duplicate prevention
✔️ Fetching link titles
✔️ How to use instructions
✔️ Optimizations and further minification
✔️ Toggle to use left mouse click instead of middle click
```

You're free to do whatever you want with this code.
